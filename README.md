Manfred is a web scraping tool that checks a given page for new entries (using css selectors) and saves them to a json file.

Currently running on my raspberry pi (results not available for the internet). Scrapes http://www.einslive.de/musik/playlists/.



# Installation
    git clone https://github.com/p0wl/manfred.git

Head your browser to http://localhost:9000 and watch the latest scraping results.
